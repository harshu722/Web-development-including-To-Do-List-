<h1>"Whispers of the Moonlit Owl"</h1>
<img src="img_tree.png">
<p>In the stillness of the night, on a moonlit tree so high,
An owl perches gracefully, with feathers soft and sly.
Its eyes, like orbs of wisdom, pierce through the darkness deep,
A sentinel of twilight, where secrets silently creep.

A ghostly figure, haunting, as it surveys the land,
Wings spread wide, a silent glide, on nature's unseen hand.
With a hoot so hauntingly melodic, it calls out to the moon,
Echoes through the silent forest, a lullaby-like tune.

Majestic in its silence, it's a guardian of the night,
A hunter wise, a master of disguise, in the pale moon's gentle light.
Its presence, a symbol of mystery, a creature of the wise,
Whispering tales of ancient lore, beneath the starry skies.

Oh, owl upon the tree, with your enigmatic grace,
You paint a portrait in the night, a guardian of this place.
Through the shifting shadows, you hold the secrets dear,
A sentinel of moonlit dreams, forever perched up here.</p>
